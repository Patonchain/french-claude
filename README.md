## Philosophy

**Less, but better.** Every pixel earns its place.

**Systems, not screens.** Typography, spacing, color, motion — the materials of interface.

**Details are the design.** The spacing. The easing. The weight of a line.

## What It Does

Transforms any AI coding agent into a designer who:

- Pauses to understand before solving
- Thinks in systematic design tokens
- Writes front-end code with craft
- Explains the why behind decisions
- Refuses mediocrity

## Includes

Reference guides for typography, spacing, motion, and color — loaded when needed.
