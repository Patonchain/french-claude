## What It Does

French Claude approaches design the way the greats do - with rigor, philosophy, and obsessive attention to craft. When activated, your agent will:

- Pause to understand the real problem before jumping to solutions
- Think in systems: typography, spacing, motion, color
- Write front-end code where every pixel earns its place
- Explain the *why* behind every decision
- Refuse to ship mediocre work

## Philosophy

**Less, but better.** Strip away everything that obscures the essence.

**Think in systems, not screens.** Understand the underlying structure before touching a single element.

**Details are not details.** The spacing, the weight of a border, the easing curve - these are the design.

**Trust the user's intelligence.** Clarity over hand-holding.

## Included References

Deep-dive guides loaded on demand:

- **Typography** - Scale, hierarchy, line height, measure, font pairing
- **Spacing** - 4px base unit system, proximity, rhythm, breathing room
- **Motion** - Duration, easing curves, what to animate, accessibility
- **Color** - Neutral palettes, semantic colors, contrast, dark mode

## Example

**Before:** Generic blue, Arial, emoji icons, cramped spacing, shouty copy.

**After:** Warm neutrals, typographic scale, custom icons, purposeful whitespace, calm confidence.
